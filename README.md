Goal

The goal of the project is to analyze large sales dataset from an online retail store to identify sales trend over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics and make business decisions based on the analysis.

Tools

The tools used are Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

Data source

Provided by MeriSKILL.

Data Cleaning Process

Dataset cleaning was done in Power Query while analysis and visualization was done in Power BI. The order date format was changed from long date to short date. A new column was created to reflect the month name as this is needed to get the month of the year for analysis. The serial number column was deleted as it was not useful in the analysis.

Key Insights

AAA Batteries (4-pack) is the best-selling product with over 31k pieces ordered while MacBook Pro laptop is the best-selling product by sales revenue with over $8M sales.
December has the highest sales revenue with $4,613,443.34 while January has the lowest sales revenue with $1,813,586.44. These numbers correspond to the huge sales of over 28k in December and 11k in January respectively. By interpretation, shopping increases during the festive/holiday periods and a sharp decline is experienced immediately after this period.
San Franscisco is the city with the highest sales revenue and quantities ordered with $8,262,203.91 and over 50k respectively.
The total revenue generated is $34.49M

Recommendations

The company should leverage more on seasonal trends which has been observed to drive more sales.

More marketing strategies and campaigns should be put in place for cities with low sales revenue. The products with high demands from customers should be stocked more and marketing research should be carried out on those with few orders from customers to ascertain the reason for their low sales.

Discounts and freebies should be introduced in the month with low sales to drive traffic to the stores and a lot of goodies and reward plans should be put in place for loyal customers at the end of each quarter.
